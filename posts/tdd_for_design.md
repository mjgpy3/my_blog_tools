When I first started using TDD, I had a very naive understanding of the process. I would sit, ponder the next test to write, write that test, write some code and repeat. Lately, I've had the awesome opportunity to practice TDD with some more experienced TDD-ers, here's what I've learned.

# TDD Is Not Static
Treating TDD as a static process was my first major mistake. When I would find myself writing overly complex tests, I would trudge on until I got stuck or wrote something difficult to maintain. When I got stuck, I would restart or stop entirely. It's almost as if I considered the tests and the code they drove to be set in stone. Since then I've learned a few things:
  - Complex tests smell, and the code they test will most likely smell too
  - Tests are not set in stone -- if they're not going well, rework! Redesign!
  - Your tests *are* your design.
