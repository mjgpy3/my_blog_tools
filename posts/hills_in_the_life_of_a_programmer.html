<p>Recently I&#39;ve gotten back into jogging. The fact that I live in the Southwestern portion of Pennsylvania, combined with my preference to run outdoors both imply that <em>hills</em> will be a very real element of my jogging experience.</p>

<p>I usually jog the same route, so today, when I started struggling up a particularly steep hill, toward the end of my route, I began to draw comparisons between the climb and my experience as a software engineer (as short as that experience may be). I realized that, my career in software is very much like jogging and the difficult times are like steep hills. At this point I came to some pretty interesting conclusions that I thought I&#39;d share.</p>

<h1>Don&#39;t Stop Jogging</h1>

<p>Jogging, for me, is an exercise in self-discipline and continuous improvement. I don&#39;t jog to shoot the breeze, or get outside (although, I may need to do more of the latter), nor do I jog for the sake of jogging itself. I jog to improve myself -- to challenge myself. <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running">The Oatmeal</a> comic strip says it better than I ever could.</p>

<p>Learning about software (tools, languages, patterns, tools, practices, etc...) is just like jogging. I learn about software to improve myself -- I learn so that I can <em>continue to learn</em>. The subject matter of software moves incredibly fast, and, therefore, we must continue to learn.</p>
