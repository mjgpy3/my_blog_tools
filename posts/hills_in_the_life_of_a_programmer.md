Recently I've gotten back into jogging. The fact that I live in the Southwestern portion of Pennsylvania, combined with my preference to run outdoors both imply that *hills* will be a very real element of my jogging experience.

I usually jog the same route, so today, when I started struggling up a particularly steep hill, toward the end of my route, I began to draw comparisons between the climb and my experience as a software engineer (as short as that experience may be). I realized that, my career in software is very much like jogging and the difficult times are like steep hills. At this point I came to some pretty interesting conclusions that I thought I'd share.

# Don't Stop Jogging

Jogging, for me, is an exercise in self-discipline and continuous improvement. I don't jog to shoot the breeze, or get outside (although, I may need to do more of the latter), nor do I jog for the sake of jogging itself. I jog to improve myself -- to challenge myself. [The Oatmeal]{http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running} comic strip says it better than I ever could.

Learning about software (tools, languages, patterns, tools, practices, etc...) is just like jogging. I learn about software to improve myself -- I learn so that I can *continue to learn*. The subject matter of software moves incredibly fast, and, therefore, we must do our best to keep up.

# There Will Be Hills

My hope is that, in the grand scheme of things, software will be an edifice of improvement. I hope that when we decide on new things, our intention is to improve old things. That being said, new things are hard to learn. This difficulty can be rooted in many things, the chief being our overwhelming laziness or perhaps our inability to "find the time." Learning new things is a hill, we must overcome.

A second hill that (I beileve) we all face in our jobs as programmers is simply, what I call the IGIDI ("I guess I'll do it") task. We've all had to write documentation that we don't care to write. We've had to attend meetings that just don't seem relevant. Before
